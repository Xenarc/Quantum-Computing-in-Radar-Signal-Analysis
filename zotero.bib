In large international projects explorative application research includes quite often both industrial software developers and experienced researchers. This kind of an experimental research environment resolves the subject problem found in student experiments. It also does not have the difficulties found in experimental design and control of industrial projects that are constrained by strict commercial conditions. {EER} strategy provides benefits for both worlds: (1) experimental software engineering research benefits from almost industry level projects that can be used as experimentation environments, and (2) future mobile telecom application research benefits from better control and understanding of the characteristics of the applications and their development methods and processes.},

Cognitive radars are systems based on the perception-action cycle of cognition that sense the environment, learn from it relevant information about the target and the background, then adapt the radar sensor to optimally satisfy the needs of their mission according to a desired goal. The concept of cognitive radar was introduced originally for active radar only. In this paper we describe how this paradigm can be applied also to passive radar. In particular, we describe (i) cognitive active radars that work in a spectrally dense environment and change the transmitted waveform on-the-fly to avoid interference with the primary user of the channel, such as broadcast or communication systems, (ii) cognitive active radars that adjust transmit waveform parameters to achieve a specified level of target tracking performance, and (iii) cognitive passive radars, that contrary to the active radars cannot directly change the transmitted waveforms, but can instead select the best source of opportunity to improve detection and tracking performance.},

For a given quantum state ρ, our method outputs a list of eigenvalue estimates and approximate probabilities. Each probability depends on the support of ρ in those eigenstates of H associated with eigenvalues within an arbitrarily small range. The complexity of our method is polynomial in the inverse of a given precision parameter ϵ, which is the gap between eigenvalue estimates. Unlike the well-known quantum phase estimation algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform, our method does not require large ancillary systems, large sequences of controlled operations, or preserving coherence between experiments, and is therefore more attractive for near-term applications. The output of our method can be used to estimate spectral properties of H and other expectation values efficiently, within additive error proportional to ϵ.},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional {SAR} modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the {SAR} forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem.},

	abstract = {Historically threat analysis were carried out through manual analysis of measured radar parameters in the {RWRs} (Radar Warning Receivers) and {ESM} (Electronic Support Measure) systems by techniques as simple as audio analysis of video signal i.e. modulating pulse train (1). As the threat environment evolved, these manual systems started generating extensive workload for the operators. With advancements in analogue and digital electronics, the threat analysers in the {EW} (Electronic Warfare) receiving systems evolved from simple analogue filter modules to sophisticated computers employing techniques ranging from simple data matching to those based on neural networks (2)(3). Emitter identification and threat analysis represent the highest level of signal processing in these systems. Usually threat analysis is combined with emitter identification (4). Unidentified emitters are considered to be threatening, even though they may not be operating in the threatening mode. A simple threat analysis approach based on syntactic pattern recognition and fuzzy logic is presented here. Threat analysis has been performed separately from emitter identification as it is expected that in a hostile environment emitters may operate with unknown parameters. This would result in relatively accurate prioritisation of the threatening emitters.},

	abstract = {The quantum Fourier transform ({QFT}), a quantum analog of the classical Fourier transform, has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum algorithms. However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete, quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum Haar and quantum Daubechies \$D{\textasciicircum}\{(4)\}\$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly. However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the quantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits that implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum circuits for the quantum wavelet transform.},

	url = {https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1334115/},
	abstract = {The multifunction radar, aided by advances in electronically steered phased array technology, is capable
of supporting numerous, differing and potentially conflicting tasks. However, the full potential of the
radar system is only realised through its ability to automatically manage and configure the finite resource
it has available. This thesis details the novel application of agent systems to this multifunction radar
resource management problem. Agent systems are computational societies where the synergy of local
interactions between agents produces emergent, global desirable behaviour.
In this thesis the measures and models which can be used to allocate radar resource is explored; this
choice of objective function is crucial as it determines which attribute is allocated resource and consequently
constitutes a description of the problem to be solved. A variety of task specific and information
theoretic measures are derived and compared. It is shown that by utilising as wide a variety of measures
and models as possible the radar’s multifunction capability is enhanced.
An agent based radar resource manager is developed using the {JADE} Framework which is used
to apply the sequential first price auction and continuous double auctions to the multifunction radar
resource management problem. The application of the sequential first price auction leads to the development
of the Sequential First Price Auction Resource Management algorithm from which numerous
novel conclusions on radar resource management algorithm design are drawn. The application of the
continuous double auction leads to the development of the Continuous Double Auction Parameter Selection
({CDAPS}) algorithm. The {CDAPS} algorithm improves the current state of the art by producing
an improved allocation with low computational burden. The algorithm is shown to give worthwhile
improvements in task performance over a conventional rule based approach for the tracking and surveillance
functions as well as exhibiting graceful degradation and adaptation to a dynamic environment.},

	abstract = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is {NP}-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.},

These techniques can be built upon in the context of cognitive radar, for example, through mission-oriented {QoS} management or stochastic control. Although basic perception-action cycles exist in operational radars, there are a number of challenges and drawbacks that must be considered before a high level of cognition can be deployed. Care should be taken in the drive toward cognitive radars, as the ultimate goal is not to have a cognitive radar for the sake of being cognitive, but to increase the radar functionality and operational performance},

Three ingredients are basic to the constitution of cognitive radar: 1) intelligent signal processing, which builds on learning through interactions of the radar with the surrounding environment; 2) feedback from the receiver to the transmitter, which is a facilitator of intelligence; and 3) preservation of the information content of radar returns, which is realized by the Bayesian approach to target detection through tracking. All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar. Radar is a remote-sensing system that is widely used for surveillance, tracking, and imaging applications, for both civilian and military needs. In this article, we focus on future possibilities of radar with particular emphasis on the issue of cognition. As an illustrative case study along the way, we consider the problem of radar surveillance applied to an ocean environment.},

This lecture series shows that {KBS} can be successfully applied to radar systems. This paper introduces the Reader to the world of radar and, specifically, to the topics tackled in the subsequent lectures of the series. The paper starts with an introduction Section 2 to radar radar evolution from the early days up today, taxonomy of radar and radar equation. Subsequently, Section 3 considers the schematic of a modern radar system. The phased-array radar is the theme of Section 4. Signal processing, one of the main building blocks of modern radar, is introduced in Section 5. The section also introduces to the various forms of adaptivity in time, space and space-time domains for natural and intentional interference mitigation. Data processing, mainly target tracking, Section 6 is the other relevant building block of radar. An extensive list of references Section 9 is helpful to the Reader for a deeper insight to the many interesting topics of radar.},

We introduce exponential-data-encoding strategies that are hardware-efficient and optimal amongst all non-entangling Pauli-encoded schemes, which is sufficient for a quantum circuit to express general functions having very broad Fourier frequency spectra using only exponentially few encoding gates. We show that such an encoding strategy not only reduces the quantum resources, but also exhibits practical resource advantage during training in contrast with known efficient classical strategies when polynomial-depth training circuits are also employed. When computation resources are constrained, we numerically demonstrate that even exponential-data-encoding circuits with single-layer training modules can generally express functions that lie outside the classically-expressible region, thereby supporting the practical benefits of such a resource advantage. Finally, we illustrate the performance of exponential encoding in learning the potential-energy surface of the ethanol molecule and California's housing prices},

While a lot of work has been done to investigate practical implications of this approach, many important theoretical properties of these models remain unknown. Here we investigate how the strategy with which data is encoded into the model influences the expressive power of parametrised quantum circuits as function approximators. We show that one can naturally write a quantum model as a partial Fourier series in the data, where the accessible frequencies are determined by the nature of the data encoding gates in the circuit. By repeating simple data encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realise all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.},

	title = {Classification of Radar Emitters Based on Pulse Repetition Interval using Machine Learning},
	abstract = {In electronic warfare, one of the key technologies is radar. Radar is used to detect and identify unknown aerial, nautical or land-based objects. An attribute of a pulsed radar signal is the Pulse Repetition Interval ({PRI}) which is the time interval between pulses in a pulse train. In a passive radar receiver system, the {PRI} can be used to recognize the emitter system. Correct classification of emitter systems is a crucial part of Electronic Support Measures ({ESM}) and Radar Warning Receivers ({RWR}) in order to deploy appropriate measures depending on the emitter system. Inaccurate predictions of emitter systems can have lethal consequences and variables such as time and confidence in the predictions are essential for an effective predictive method. Due to the classified nature of military systems and techniques, there are no industry standard systems or techniques that perform quick and accurate classifications of emitter systems based on {PRI}. Therefore, methods that allow for fast and accurate predictions based on {PRI} are highly desirable and worthy of research. This thesis explores and compares the capabilities of two machine learning methods for the task of classifying emitters based on received {PRI}. The first method is an attention based model which performs well throughout all levels of realistic noise and is quick to learn and even quicker to give accurate predictions. The second method is a K-Nearest Neighbor ({KNN}) implementation that, while performing well for noise-free {PRI}, finds its performance degrading as the amount of noise increases. An additional outcome of this thesis is the development of a system to generate samples in an automated fashion. The attention based model performs well, achieving a macro average F1-score of 63\% in the 59-class recognition task whereas the performance of the {KNN} is lower, achieving a macro average F1-score of 43\%. Future research could be conducted with the purpose of designing a better attention based model for producing higher and more confident predictions and designing algorithms to reduce the time complexity of the {KNN} implementation.},

	abstract = {Weak signal detection is a basic and important problem in radar systems. The detectable range of a radar is determined by the radar equation. This equation shows that the performance of a radar is improved by increasing the receiver output {SNR}. For the purpose of improving the {SNR}, the process called "integration of pulses" has been used. We propose new methods based on the wavelet transform for the improvement of the {SNR}. The wavelet transform is a tool for time-frequency domain signal analysis and is sensitive to the transient signals. By computer simulations, we show that the receiver output {SNR} after the wavelet transform is applied becomes about 8 {dB} greater than that of the original signals. This value corresponds to a 60 percent improvement of the radar detectable range.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

We use short time Fourier transform to obtain timefrequency image of the signal. Hough transform is used to detect pulses in time-frequency images and pulses are represented with a single line. Then, convolutional neural networks are used for pulse classiﬁcation. In experiments, we provide classiﬁcation results at different {SNR} levels.},

In this paper, we introduce recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) to mine and exploit long-term temporal patterns in streams and solve problems of sequential pattern classification, denoising, and deinterleaving of pulse streams. {RNNs} mine temporal patterns from previously collected streams of certain classes via supervised learning. The learned patterns are stored in the trained {RNNs}, which can then be used to recognize patterns-of-interest in testing streams and categorize them to different classes, and also predict features of upcoming pulses based on features of preceding ones. As predicted features contain sufficient information for distinguishing between pulses-of-interest and noises or interfering pulses, they are then used to solve problems of denoising and deinterleaving of noise-contaminated and aliasing streams. Detailed introductions of the methods, together with explanative simulation results, are presented to describe the procedures and behaviors of the {RNNs} in solving the aimed problems. Statistical results are provided to show satisfying performances of the proposed methods.},

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Electronic warfare ({EW}) receivers are passive receivers which receive emissions from other platforms, and do certain analysis on these emissions. Some {EW} receivers receive radar pulses, measure the parameter of each pulse received and group the pulses that belongs to the same emitter together to determine the radar parameters for each emitter. These parameters are then compared with values stored for known radar types, to identify the emitter type. Two parts are focused, emitters deinterleaving and {PRF}-type identification. The deinterleaving is done through parameters clustering. Two parameters are selected for clustering direction of arrival and radio frequency. A self-organising neural network called Fuzzy {ART} is proposed for clustering. This algorithm has a very good clustering quality and can run in real-time applications.The {PRF}-type identification is done through time-of-arrival ({TOA}) analysis. Three previously presented algorithms are combined in new scheme to do the {TOA} analysis (or {PRF}-type identification). These algorithms are difference {TOA} histogram, {TOA} folding histogram and sequence search algorithm. The complete proposed system has been tested using three different tests. These tests are simple {PRI} test, jittered {PRI} test and staggered {PRI} test. The proposed system identifies up to 90 simple emitters, 20 jittered emitters and 20 staggered emitters. In all tests, the data were simulated and generated using software.},

	abstract = {As was mentioned, rain and other forms of precipitation can cause echo signals that mask the desired target echoes. There are other atmospheric phenomena that can affect radar performance as well. The decrease in density of the Earth’s atmosphere with increasing altitude causes radar waves to bend as they propagate through the atmosphere. This usually increases the detection range at low angles to a slight extent. The atmosphere can form “ducts” that trap and guide radar energy around the curvature of the Earth and allow detection at ranges beyond the normal horizon. Ducting over water is more likely to occur},

	abstract = {This chapter has tried to show the basics of the Radar which helps to detect target range, direction, and motion. It is a Radio detection Ranging. It has been used since the second world war. The frequency of the radio waves depends on the radar application. Radar systems are often designated by the wavelength or frequency band in which they operate. Higher frequency systems usually are lower power due to electronic circuit limitations, and they experience greater atmospheric attenuation. Most airborne radars operate between the L and Ka bands, also known as the microwave region. Many short-range targeting radars, such as on a tank or helicopter, operate in the millimeter band. The shape and contours of the aircraft also greatly influence the radar cross-section. In radar systems, sequences known as Barker sequences are sometimes used. Most radars have thousands of range bins. They may scan wide sweeps of azimuth and elevation. Filtering or convolving the receive signals by using matched filters is a computationally intense process. This could be done using {FIR} filters. However, in order to reduce the amount of computations, another method is often used.},

	abstract = {Beamforming is a powerful technique which has been widely used in signal processing, radar and sonar, biomedical, and particularly in communications, where the basic idea is to optimally process signals received over different antennas, or the signals which are to be transmitted over different paths by adjusting the signal amplitudes and phases to form a strong beam toward the direction of interest, and at the same time, to avoid receiving or creating interference. In the past decade, with booming research in cooperative relay communications, a new type of beamforming, namely network beamforming, has appeared and developed to fulfill the needs of the ever-evolving wireless systems. A network beamformer is implemented at neither the transmitter nor the receiver but at the intermediate relays to adaptively process signals and conduct the tasks of both the receive beamformer and the transmit beamformer. In this chapter, a systematic overview of various network beamforming approaches and solutions are presented for multi-relay cooperative networks with a wide variety of configurations, including one-way and two-way communications, single-user and multi-user cases, flat-fading and frequency-selective channel models, and networks with perfect and partial channel state information.},

	abstract = {Radar technology has improved over many decades. Improvements in hardware, software, and adaptive signal processing have dramatically expanded the inherent potential of radar systems to operate in an agile, less rigid manner. Yet despite the underlying growth in technology, the fundamental manner in which radar systems collect their data has not significantly changed—most fielded radar systems still capture data according to rigid, predefined patterns using a limited selection of waveform types and parameters. Few systems proactively optimize the quality of the data received—at least not to the extent envisioned by the research community working to develop the new paradigm of cognitive radar. This chapter presents cognitive radar as a new paradigm for radar operation. All radar systems constantly observe the surrounding environment, inferring properties about the environment based on observations, and modifying its observation of the environment through changing waveforms and antenna pointing direction. In cognitive radar, however, the system maintains real-time hypotheses about the environment in order to adaptively control the form and parameters of the actual sensing procedure. In other words, prior and current knowledge are quantified and updated in real time in order to optimize the sensing procedure in a closed-loop manner, thereby optimizing radar performance and making efficient use of finite sensing resources. This chapter describes the properties of cognitive radar systems, some essential technologies, potential applications, and fundamental examples that show how adaptive sensing can improve performance.},
