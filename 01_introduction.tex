\todojc{good to start broad with "EW" but further narrow it down to "radar signals for EW"}In the complex and ever-evolving world of electronic warfare (EW), quantum computing could provide the ability to understand electromagnetic signals in novel ways, never before seen in this field. 
It is widely recognised in the discipline of electronic warfare that traditional signal analysis techniques are still bounded by computational constraints, so in order to maintain strategic advantage, new techniques are continuously needed in order to keep pace with emerging threats.

\subsection{Background}~\label{subsec:background}

Radar is "an electrical system that transmits radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic (EM) waves toward a region of interest and receives and detects these EM waves when reflected
from objects in that region."\cite{richards_principles_2010}. The name radar originates from a portmanteau of \textit{Radio Detection and Ranging}\cite{the_joint_board_on_scientific_information_policy_radar_1945}, hinting at it's founding objectives in the defence context. In the modern day, radar is used in many civilian and military applications \cite{merrill_i_skolnik_radar_nodate, desai_how_2022}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aerospace - weather, navigation, approach, altitude, identification
    \item Maritime - navigation, collision avoidance,  
    \item Ground Penetrating - archaeology, mining, oceanographic sounding
    \item Space - spacecraft and celestial monitoring
    \item Automotive - civilian and law enforcement
    \item Industrial - fluid sensing, speed measurement
    \item Medical
    \item Atmospheric / Weather
    \item Electronic Warfare
\end{itemize}

Since radar systems were invented in 1935\todojc{You have many empty citations, please correct}\cite{}, their usage has become increasingly widespread. As a result, the electromagnetic environment has become densely populated, with a multitude of different emitters posing a challenge of unintentional interference with operating radars \cite{}. However, their widespread adoption - particularly in the defence context - yields the potential to identify the location and type of emitters in the area of operation.\todo{Passive; ESM}
This subject has been encompassed in the broader discipline of \textit{Electronic Warfare} (EW). EW is defined by David Adamy \todo{Instead of "in EW101" give a proper citation} as "the art and science of preserving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for friendly use while denying its use to the enemy"\todo{I think a different definition would be best here, or perhaps referencing ELINT...}.

\textit{Electronic Support Measures} (ESM), a sub-field of the EW, where ESM as "the receiving part of EW"\cite{adamy_13_2001}, of which radar is the principal element".

\todo{Describe the importance of radar ESM here. Who cares and why? }


\todo{Principles of radar}

A typical radar system is made up of at least one of each: radio transmitter, radio receiver, antenna, and display\cite{stimson_introduction_1998}. % There was a more precise definition somewhere with a 'signal processor' element.

\todo{Link back to: Electronic Support Measures, Electronic Countermeasures, and Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures. Here, consider providing a precise definition of ESM. Also, somewhere here, a mention of ELINT should be made}


For the radar to achieve its objectives, it must be able to convert observed data into actionable information, thereby requiring some degree of information processing. Herein lies the general challenges in ESM - the detection, location, and identification of targets, which will now be explored. % Cite 'detection, location and identification' - I think the precise term is 'analysis'.

First, however, a conceptual schematisation of this system must be made in in terms of its inputs, process, and outputs. In ESM, inputs consist of EM fluctuations that vary over time. They are almost always received by an antenna (or antennas) which may be subsequently manipulated in the analogue and digital domains. These fluctuations, henceforth \textit{signals} (not to be confused with communications signals), are the essential information carriers in the signal processing operation. There also exist inputs derived from the nature of the radar system configuration itself. These may include the antenna configuration and receiver architecture which will not here be considered, but is noted by the author as being of significant relevance to kinematic measurement and capability constraints.


Since the signals of interest are those emitted by radar systems, the received signals exhibit phenomenal qualities corresponding to those of the originating radar, namely: \cite{avionics_department_electronic_2013} 5-8.1
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency (RF): Intrapulse frequency, modulation (and associated modulation parameters); Interpulse: phase coherence.
    \item Amplitude (power)
    \item Direction of Arrival (DOA) - also called Angle of Arrival (AOA)
    \item Time of Arrival (TOA)
    \item Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI), or pulse repitition frequency (PRF)
    \item PRI type
    \item Pulse Width (PW)
    \item Scan type and rate
    \item Lobe duration (beam width or dwell)
\end{itemize}

The role of the processing step, is to convert the 'raw' signal into these parameters. Optimally, the parameters equal those nominally transmitted by the target radar.
These are generally extracted from the incident EM signals and may be treated independently as outputs themselves. Typically, however, further analysis may be may conducted to yield very granular information. Information that ESM seeks to understand addresses many facets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detection
    \item Target characteristics \cite{jenn_radar_2007}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item target size - return amplitude
        \item target shape - from discrete scan returns
        \item target material composition
        \item moving parts (modulation of the return)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Target identification
    \item Kinematic parameters and tracking(range, direction, speed, angle of arrival)
\end{itemize}

\todo{Introduce multi-radar concept. }
\todo{Illustrate a scenario to make the problem more evident.}

\subsubsection{Research Question}
\todojc{I've renamed "Thesis" to "Research Question"}\textbf{To what extent can quantum computing methods can quantum computing be used to understand radar
signals?}

    % \item Gauge possible quantum methods for de-interleaving radar signals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}

Depending on the speed of progress throughout the honours project, the scope of the project will change. The extent of exploration into these concepts is wholly dependent on the available time. The scope should therefore not be defined fixed in time, but rather prioritised by level of desirability. At each level of scope, a definition of done must have been both defined and then met before proceeding to the next.

% ---------------
% OLD EXPLANATION
% ---------------
% One category of radar is pulsed-Doppler which emits energy in high-frequency pulses. The characteristics of the pulses impact the range resolution, with shorter pulses allowing for higher resolution because the receive signal is too shorter. However, the trade-off is that a shorter pulse means less time for the emission to illuminate the target, and therefore less return amplitude and shorter maximum range. One way to counter this issue is to use a technique named ‘pulse compression’. In principle, the technique bypasses this limitation by transmitting infinitely short pulses. How? By means of frequency modulation; by ramping the transmission frequency linearly up or down. The difficulty is: how to receive a single pulse over these many frequencies. The solution is in using an analogue filter with a non-linear phase response which causes lower frequencies to be ‘delayed’ or phase-shifted, more than higher frequencies, In effect it ‘compresses’ the returned pulse into a higher power pulse, thereby increasing both range resolution, and maximum range. This, however, is not enough. Higher range and resolution are desired – and that means more power! A single pulse is alone insufficient in solving the problem; the solution lays in multiple pulses. By sending more than one pulse, one increases the average transmitted power on the target (and thus returns). With multiple pulses, the chances of a return being intercepted are increased. These pulses must be transmitted consecutively therefore, at some Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). However effective upon first thought, a limitation always arises – range ambiguity. If a pulse is transmitted and, before the its return received, another pulse arrives,  \cite{parker_chapter_2010}
