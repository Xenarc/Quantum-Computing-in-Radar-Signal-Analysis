\subsection{Research Plan}

The milestones for the project are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Acquire a signal simulator; generate source data with valid radar models
    \item Identify, and implement several quantum-based encoding methods that convert sampled time-domain radar signals into a form which prepares them for further quantum processing.
    \item Develop a method for quantum-based pulse detection of a radar signals. Test the method by varying the type and quality of radar signals. Present quantifiably measurable results.
    \item Determine a quantum method for estimating a radar signalâ€™s frequency. Test the algorithm on a variety of radar signals and present quantitative results of its performance.
\end{enumerate}

The research plan is, in the first phase in T1, to conduct experiment 1 - encoding. In the second phase - T2, to continue with executing experiments 2 and 3.
