  abstract = {This paper introduces to the lecture series dedicated to the knowledge-based radar signal and data processing. Knowledge-based expert system (KBS) is in the realm of artificial intelligence. KBS consists of a knowledge base containing information specific to a problem domain and an inference engine that employs reasoning to yield decisions. KBS have been built: some are very complex with thousands rules while others, relatively simple, are designed to tackle very specialised tasks. This lecture series shows that KBS can be successfully applied to radar systems. This paper introduces the Reader to the world of radar and, specifically, to the topics tackled in the subsequent lectures of the series. The paper starts with an introduction (Section 2) to radar (radar evolution from the early days up today, taxonomy of radar and radar equation). Subsequently, Section 3 considers the schematic of a modern radar system. The phased-array radar is the theme of Section 4. Signal processing, one of the main building blocks of modern radar, is introduced in Section 5. The section also introduces to the various forms of adaptivity in time, space and space-time domains for natural and intentional interference mitigation. Data processing, mainly target tracking, (Section 6) is the other relevant building block of radar. An extensive list of references (Section 9) is helpful to the Reader for a deeper insight to the many interesting topics of radar.},

  abstract = {Recently, due to the wide application of low probability of intercept (LPI) radar, lots of recognition approaches about LPI radar signal modulations have been proposed. However, facing the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment, most existing methods have poor performance to identify different modulation types in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper proposes an automatic recognition method for different LPI radar signal modulations. Firstly, time-domain signals are converted to time-frequency images (TFIs) by smooth pseudo-Wigner\textendash Ville distribution. Then, these TFIs are fed into a designed triplet convolutional neural network (TCNN) to obtain high-dimensional feature vectors. In essence, TCNN is a CNN network that triplet loss is adopted to optimize parameters of the network in the training process. The participation of triplet loss can ensure that the distance between samples in different classes is greater than that between samples with the same label, improving the discriminability of TCNN. Eventually, a fully connected neural network is employed as the classifier to recognize different modulation types. Simulation shows that the overall recognition success rate can achieve 94\% at -~10~dB, which proves the proposed method has a strong discriminating capability for the recognition of different LPI radar signal modulations, even under low SNR.},

The next generation of 4D radar can achieve imaging capability in the form of high-resolution point clouds. In this context, we believe that the era of deep learning for radar perception has arrived. However, studies on radar deep learning are spread across different tasks, and a holistic overview is lacking. This review paper attempts to provide a big picture of the deep radar perception stack, including signal processing, datasets, labelling, data augmentation, and downstream tasks such as depth and velocity estimation, object detection, and sensor fusion. For these tasks, we focus on explaining how the network structure is adapted to radar domain knowledge. In particular, we summarise three overlooked challenges in deep radar perception, including multi-path effects, uncertainty problems, and adverse weather effects, and present some attempts to solve them.},

	abstract = {Radar technology has improved over many decades. Improvements in hardware, software, and adaptive signal processing have dramatically expanded the inherent potential of radar systems to operate in an agile, less rigid manner. Yet despite the underlying growth in technology, the fundamental manner in which radar systems collect their data has not significantly changed—most fielded radar systems still capture data according to rigid, predefined patterns using a limited selection of waveform types and parameters. Few systems proactively optimize the quality of the data received—at least not to the extent envisioned by the research community working to develop the new paradigm of cognitive radar. This chapter presents cognitive radar as a new paradigm for radar operation. All radar systems constantly observe the surrounding environment, inferring properties about the environment based on observations, and modifying its observation of the environment through changing waveforms and antenna pointing direction. In cognitive radar, however, the system maintains real-time hypotheses about the environment in order to adaptively control the form and parameters of the actual sensing procedure. In other words, prior and current knowledge are quantified and updated in real time in order to optimize the sensing procedure in a closed-loop manner, thereby optimizing radar performance and making efficient use of finite sensing resources. This chapter describes the properties of cognitive radar systems, some essential technologies, potential applications, and fundamental examples that show how adaptive sensing can improve performance.},

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of and address various important signal processing aspects of massive {MIMO} systems. We first discuss the information-theoretic pathway toward the development of massive {MIMO} systems, then briefly introduce standard precoding and decoding techniques, identify the key signal processing challenges, such as channel estimation and pilot contamination, along with possible solutions, and finally highlight some future research directions.},

	abstract = {Beamforming is a powerful technique which has been widely used in signal processing, radar and sonar, biomedical, and particularly in communications, where the basic idea is to optimally process signals received over different antennas, or the signals which are to be transmitted over different paths by adjusting the signal amplitudes and phases to form a strong beam toward the direction of interest, and at the same time, to avoid receiving or creating interference. In the past decade, with booming research in cooperative relay communications, a new type of beamforming, namely network beamforming, has appeared and developed to fulfill the needs of the ever-evolving wireless systems. A network beamformer is implemented at neither the transmitter nor the receiver but at the intermediate relays to adaptively process signals and conduct the tasks of both the receive beamformer and the transmit beamformer. In this chapter, a systematic overview of various network beamforming approaches and solutions are presented for multi-relay cooperative networks with a wide variety of configurations, including one-way and two-way communications, single-user and multi-user cases, flat-fading and frequency-selective channel models, and networks with perfect and partial channel state information.},

Cognitive radars are systems based on the perception-action cycle of cognition that sense the environment, learn from it relevant information about the target and the background, then adapt the radar sensor to optimally satisfy the needs of their mission according to a desired goal. The concept of cognitive radar was introduced originally for active radar only. In this paper we describe how this paradigm can be applied also to passive radar. In particular, we describe (i) cognitive active radars that work in a spectrally dense environment and change the transmitted waveform on-the-fly to avoid interference with the primary user of the channel, such as broadcast or communication systems, (ii) cognitive active radars that adjust transmit waveform parameters to achieve a specified level of target tracking performance, and (iii) cognitive passive radars, that contrary to the active radars cannot directly change the transmitted waveforms, but can instead select the best source of opportunity to improve detection and tracking performance.},

	abstract = {This chapter has tried to show the basics of the Radar which helps to detect target range, direction, and motion. It is a Radio detection Ranging. It has been used since the second world war. The frequency of the radio waves depends on the radar application. Radar systems are often designated by the wavelength or frequency band in which they operate. Higher frequency systems usually are lower power due to electronic circuit limitations, and they experience greater atmospheric attenuation. Most airborne radars operate between the L and Ka bands, also known as the microwave region. Many short-range targeting radars, such as on a tank or helicopter, operate in the millimeter band. The shape and contours of the aircraft also greatly influence the radar cross-section. In radar systems, sequences known as Barker sequences are sometimes used. Most radars have thousands of range bins. They may scan wide sweeps of azimuth and elevation. Filtering or convolving the receive signals by using matched filters is a computationally intense process. This could be done using {FIR} filters. However, in order to reduce the amount of computations, another method is often used.},

The survey is done based on selected forty three papers to illustrate existing algorithms for the radar resource optimization problem. The algorithms are categorized into six categories, where the first 3 categories are adaptive scheduling algorithms and the remaining categories are resource aided algorithms. The resource aided algorithms are relevant since a better algorithm needs less resource to achieve the same performance.},

	abstract = {Joint radar and communication ({JRC}) technology has become important for civil and military applications for decades. This paper introduces the concepts, characteristics and advantages of {JRC} technology, presenting the typical applications that have benefited from {JRC} technology currently and in the future. This paper explores the state-of-the-art of {JRC} in the levels of coexistence, cooperation, co-design and collaboration. Compared to previous surveys, this paper reviews the entire trends that drive the development of radar sensing and wireless communication using {JRC}. Specifically, we explore an open research issue on radar and communication operating with mutual benefits based on collaboration, which represents the fourth stage of {JRC} evolution. This paper provides useful perspectives for future researches of {JRC} technology.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive and well-structured review on the application of deep learning ({DL}) based algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) and long-short term memory ({LSTM}), in radar signal processing is given. The following {DL} application areas are covered: i) radar waveform and antenna array design; ii) passive or low probability of interception ({LPI}) radar waveform recognition; iii) automatic target recognition ({ATR}) based on high range resolution profiles ({HRRPs}), Doppler signatures, and synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) images; and iv) radar jamming/clutter recognition and suppression. Although {DL} is unanimously praised as the ultimate solution to many bottleneck problems in most of existing works on similar topics, both the positive and the negative sides of stories about {DL} are checked in this work. Specifically, two limiting factors of the real-life performance of deep neural networks ({DNNs}), limited training samples and adversarial examples, are thoroughly examined. By investigating the relationship between the {DL}-based algorithms proposed in various papers and linking them together to form a full picture, this work serves as a valuable source for researchers who are seeking potential research opportunities in this promising research field.},

	abstract = {The future Internet of Things will integrate sensing and wireless communications. Among the multiple types of sensors to be used, sensors based on the radar principles are of interest for several applications, namely automotive. Dual functionality devices that integrate reflectometry and communication capabilities will be important to reduce development costs through the reuse of modules and to optimise the usage of radio resources, e.g. spectrum. This paper reviews the main trends that push for the merging of radar type sensors and wireless communications ({RadCom}). It presents the most important use cases that can be currently foreseen and identifies the main technology trends and issues to reach a mature technology, focusing on {OFDM} type waveforms that will enable a smooth integration with 4G and 5G.},
