  abstract = {This paper introduces to the lecture series dedicated to the knowledge-based radar signal and data processing. Knowledge-based expert system (KBS) is in the realm of artificial intelligence. KBS consists of a knowledge base containing information specific to a problem domain and an inference engine that employs reasoning to yield decisions. KBS have been built: some are very complex with thousands rules while others, relatively simple, are designed to tackle very specialised tasks. This lecture series shows that KBS can be successfully applied to radar systems. This paper introduces the Reader to the world of radar and, specifically, to the topics tackled in the subsequent lectures of the series. The paper starts with an introduction (Section 2) to radar (radar evolution from the early days up today, taxonomy of radar and radar equation). Subsequently, Section 3 considers the schematic of a modern radar system. The phased-array radar is the theme of Section 4. Signal processing, one of the main building blocks of modern radar, is introduced in Section 5. The section also introduces to the various forms of adaptivity in time, space and space-time domains for natural and intentional interference mitigation. Data processing, mainly target tracking, (Section 6) is the other relevant building block of radar. An extensive list of references (Section 9) is helpful to the Reader for a deeper insight to the many interesting topics of radar.}

  abstract = {Recently, due to the wide application of low probability of intercept (LPI) radar, lots of recognition approaches about LPI radar signal modulations have been proposed. However, facing the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment, most existing methods have poor performance to identify different modulation types in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper proposes an automatic recognition method for different LPI radar signal modulations. Firstly, time-domain signals are converted to time-frequency images (TFIs) by smooth pseudo-Wigner\textendash Ville distribution. Then, these TFIs are fed into a designed triplet convolutional neural network (TCNN) to obtain high-dimensional feature vectors. In essence, TCNN is a CNN network that triplet loss is adopted to optimize parameters of the network in the training process. The participation of triplet loss can ensure that the distance between samples in different classes is greater than that between samples with the same label, improving the discriminability of TCNN. Eventually, a fully connected neural network is employed as the classifier to recognize different modulation types. Simulation shows that the overall recognition success rate can achieve 94\% at -~10~dB, which proves the proposed method has a strong discriminating capability for the recognition of different LPI radar signal modulations, even under low SNR.},

  abstract = {With recent developments, the performance of automotive radar has improved significantly. The next generation of 4D radar can achieve imaging capability in the form of high-resolution point clouds. In this context, we believe that the era of deep learning for radar perception has arrived. However, studies on radar deep learning are spread across different tasks, and a holistic overview is lacking. This review paper attempts to provide a big picture of the deep radar perception stack, including signal processing, datasets, labelling, data augmentation, and downstream tasks such as depth and velocity estimation, object detection, and sensor fusion. For these tasks, we focus on explaining how the network structure is adapted to radar domain knowledge. In particular, we summarise three overlooked challenges in deep radar perception, including multi-path effects, uncertainty problems, and adverse weather effects, and present some attempts to solve them.},
