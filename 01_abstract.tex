\section*{Abstract}

This study explores the applications of quantum computing methods to radar signal analysis for \ac{ESM}.
As the dense signal environment continues to pose challenges, traditional signal processing techniques are struggling to keep up. Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these emerging threats.
While there is some research exploring new techniques in radar signal processing  - such as \ac{AI} and \ac{ML} - surprisingly little work has been done in quantum computing's application to \ac{EW} signal processing.
This report presents a survey of current research and an exploratory probe into quantum encoding, pulse detection, and frequency characterisation of radar signals.
