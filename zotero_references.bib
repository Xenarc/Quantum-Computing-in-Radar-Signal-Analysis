	abstract = {As was mentioned, rain and other forms of precipitation can cause echo signals that mask the desired target echoes. There are other atmospheric phenomena that can affect radar performance as well. The decrease in density of the Earth’s atmosphere with increasing altitude causes radar waves to bend as they propagate through the atmosphere. This usually increases the detection range at low angles to a slight extent. The atmosphere can form “ducts” that trap and guide radar energy around the curvature of the Earth and allow detection at ranges beyond the normal horizon. Ducting over water is more likely to occur},

	abstract = {This chapter has tried to show the basics of the Radar which helps to detect target range, direction, and motion. It is a Radio detection Ranging. It has been used since the second world war. The frequency of the radio waves depends on the radar application. Radar systems are often designated by the wavelength or frequency band in which they operate. Higher frequency systems usually are lower power due to electronic circuit limitations, and they experience greater atmospheric attenuation. Most airborne radars operate between the L and Ka bands, also known as the microwave region. Many short-range targeting radars, such as on a tank or helicopter, operate in the millimeter band. The shape and contours of the aircraft also greatly influence the radar cross-section. In radar systems, sequences known as Barker sequences are sometimes used. Most radars have thousands of range bins. They may scan wide sweeps of azimuth and elevation. Filtering or convolving the receive signals by using matched filters is a computationally intense process. This could be done using FIR filters. However, in order to reduce the amount of computations, another method is often used.},

Cognitive radars are systems based on the perception-action cycle of cognition that sense the environment, learn from it relevant information about the target and the background, then adapt the radar sensor to optimally satisfy the needs of their mission according to a desired goal. The concept of cognitive radar was introduced originally for active radar only. In this paper we describe how this paradigm can be applied also to passive radar. In particular, we describe (i) cognitive active radars that work in a spectrally dense environment and change the transmitted waveform on-the-fly to avoid interference with the primary user of the channel, such as broadcast or communication systems, (ii) cognitive active radars that adjust transmit waveform parameters to achieve a specified level of target tracking performance, and (iii) cognitive passive radars, that contrary to the active radars cannot directly change the transmitted waveforms, but can instead select the best source of opportunity to improve detection and tracking performance.},

	abstract = {Beamforming is a powerful technique which has been widely used in signal processing, radar and sonar, biomedical, and particularly in communications, where the basic idea is to optimally process signals received over different antennas, or the signals which are to be transmitted over different paths by adjusting the signal amplitudes and phases to form a strong beam toward the direction of interest, and at the same time, to avoid receiving or creating interference. In the past decade, with booming research in cooperative relay communications, a new type of beamforming, namely network beamforming, has appeared and developed to fulfill the needs of the ever-evolving wireless systems. A network beamformer is implemented at neither the transmitter nor the receiver but at the intermediate relays to adaptively process signals and conduct the tasks of both the receive beamformer and the transmit beamformer. In this chapter, a systematic overview of various network beamforming approaches and solutions are presented for multi-relay cooperative networks with a wide variety of configurations, including one-way and two-way communications, single-user and multi-user cases, flat-fading and frequency-selective channel models, and networks with perfect and partial channel state information.},

	abstract = {Radar technology has improved over many decades. Improvements in hardware, software, and adaptive signal processing have dramatically expanded the inherent potential of radar systems to operate in an agile, less rigid manner. Yet despite the underlying growth in technology, the fundamental manner in which radar systems collect their data has not significantly changed—most fielded radar systems still capture data according to rigid, predefined patterns using a limited selection of waveform types and parameters. Few systems proactively optimize the quality of the data received—at least not to the extent envisioned by the research community working to develop the new paradigm of cognitive radar. This chapter presents cognitive radar as a new paradigm for radar operation. All radar systems constantly observe the surrounding environment, inferring properties about the environment based on observations, and modifying its observation of the environment through changing waveforms and antenna pointing direction. In cognitive radar, however, the system maintains real-time hypotheses about the environment in order to adaptively control the form and parameters of the actual sensing procedure. In other words, prior and current knowledge are quantified and updated in real time in order to optimize the sensing procedure in a closed-loop manner, thereby optimizing radar performance and making efficient use of finite sensing resources. This chapter describes the properties of cognitive radar systems, some essential technologies, potential applications, and fundamental examples that show how adaptive sensing can improve performance.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive and well-structured review on the application of deep learning (DL) based algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM), in radar signal processing is given. The following DL application areas are covered: i) radar waveform and antenna array design; ii) passive or low probability of interception (LPI) radar waveform recognition; iii) automatic target recognition (ATR) based on high range resolution profiles (HRRPs), Doppler signatures, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; and iv) radar jamming/clutter recognition and suppression. Although DL is unanimously praised as the ultimate solution to many bottleneck problems in most of existing works on similar topics, both the positive and the negative sides of stories about DL are checked in this work. Specifically, two limiting factors of the real-life performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), limited training samples and adversarial examples, are thoroughly examined. By investigating the relationship between the DL-based algorithms proposed in various papers and linking them together to form a full picture, this work serves as a valuable source for researchers who are seeking potential research opportunities in this promising research field.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent advances in deep learning, we lay out a vision of how deep learning techniques can be used in radar. Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem.},
